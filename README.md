The front-end was designed using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaSript. A front-end framework wasn't used. The backend was built using JavaScript's Node library, and Express was used to design the server-side logic. A MySql database is integrated to perform CRUD operations on important company Data.
- the server side code is contained in the index.js file
-- the frontend files are inside the *Public* folder. HTML and Javascript files are inside the HTML and JS folders, respectively.
- HTML folder contains Invoices, Forms, and Reports folders. The folder also contains the HTML file for the main page *main.html*
- Invoices contains the HTML file for an invoice.
- Reports folder contains the Order Report file.
- Forms folder contains the html files for all the forms used in the application.
